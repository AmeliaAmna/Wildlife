        <h1>YALA NATIONAL PARK</h1><br>
        <p>One of Sri Lanka's must-see locations is Yala National Park, sometimes called Ruhuna National Park. This outstanding game reserve, 
           which is the most well-known in Sri Lanka, is situated in the southeast of the country for good reason. Yala is split into five 
           blocks and has an area of 1,260 square kilometers. It is said to have the highest density of leopards per square kilometer in the 
           world. The most popular area of the reserve is Block I, which also offers the best opportunities for a leopard safari. Although 
           leopards are normally difficult to spot, sightings in Yala are very good; you may see them lounging in the sun on rocky outcrops, 
           in trees, across paths, and next to waterholes. In addition to leopards, Asian elephants, sloth bears, and.(ugaescape, 2023)<br><br>

                <p>The headline may bring you other ideas, but contrary to popular beliefs, the jungle has rules, as much as cities do! Believe it 
                   or not, some of these rules may even be tougher than in your hometown. You must remember that rules pertain not just to animals 
                   and your conduct but also extend to the plant life and soil, ancient ruins etc. Violations may be punishable with fine and/or prison
                   term, so take heed, obey the law. Don't do it just out of fear; do it because you care!

                <p>Sithulpauwwa
                    The name Sithulpauwwa is derived from the word 'Chittalapabbata' which means the hill of the quiet mind. The ancient rock 
                    temple is a place of worship for devotees. It is believed that in ancient times this rock temple housed a total of 12,000 
                    monks.
                    
                    Magul Maha Viharaya
                    Located to the south of Sithulpauwa, Magul Maha Viharaya is believed to have provided the setting for the marriage of King 
                    KavanTissa to Vihara Maha Devi. One could combine a visit to Sithulpauwe and Magul MahaViharaya as they are located closely 
                    together.
